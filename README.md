# Overview

In this project,  experiment has been done with two different search approaches named
bottom-up search and Breadth First Search[1] to find the correct expression generated from
a given Domain Specific Language(DSL) for a given set of input-output. The DSL for the
experiment is available in the report.pdf.


# Set Up
```
# Setup python virtual environment
$ virtualenv venv --python=python3
$ source venv/bin/activate

# clone the repo
$git clone https://github.com/rayhan1577/Program_synthesis_using_BUS_and_BFS.git

# change directory to the repo where we have requirements file
$ cd Program_synthesis_using_BUS_and_BFS

```

# Execute
To Run Bottom_up_search: python3 BUS.py
To Run Breadth_first_search: python3 BFS.py


# Output
---
- output of Bottom up search will be shown on terminal
- Output of BFS will also be shon on terminal side by side generated expression will be available at output.txt
